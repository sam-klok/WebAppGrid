I'm trying to play with popular GridMvc component.

This is .Net Framework 4.7.2 and Grid.Mvc 3.0.0

Used tutorials, all of them just OK, but better than nothing:

1. How to Use MVC Grid in ASP.NET MVC | C# | Razor | Pagination | Sorting | Filtering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-NCcY-J9B8

2. Filtering was not working, and I was getting error 
"Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined at gridmvc.js:9:1", 
which told me that jQuery is not loaded (see below). 

* Grid.Mvc
* Examples and documentation at: http://gridmvc.codeplex.com
* Version: 3.0.0
* Requires: window.jQuery v1.3+
